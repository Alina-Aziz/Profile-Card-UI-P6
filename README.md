# Profile-Card-UI-P6
This project showcases a sleek and modern Profile Card UI designed using HTML and CSS. It features a responsive layout with a profile image, user details, social media icons, buttons for interaction, and key analytics sections like likes, messages, and shares. The goal is to practice layout design, element positioning, and styling in CSS. The card is fully customizable and can be integrated into personal websites, portfolios, or any web project requiring a user profile section.

Feel free to explore, customize, and contribute to improve this profile card UI!
